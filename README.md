# GBAUGOLF-Handicap-Calculator
Here is the code in action https://gbaugolf-handicap-calculator.onrender.com

Built a full-stack golf handicap calculator with Flask and JavaScript, deployed using Render. Learned deployment, REST APIs, and Git/GitHub workflows.
This project was a good start to getting used to using Flask, HTML, and JavaScript.
